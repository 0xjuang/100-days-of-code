# 100 Days of Code – Python Edition

A 100-day challenge to level up my Python and automation skills — one project at a time.

This repository tracks my progress through the 100 Days of Code challenge, focusing on Python fundamentals, small projects, and hands-on scripting practice. Each day includes a folder with source code and a short write-up of what I learned.
