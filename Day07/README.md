# Day 07 – Hangman

## 📝 Description  
A classic Hangman game that lets the user guess a hidden word, one letter at a time. The game provides visual feedback using ASCII art and tracks the number of remaining attempts.

## 🧠 Notes  
- Practiced modular Python by separating ASCII art and word lists into external modules (`hangman_art.py` and `hangman_words.py`).
- Reinforced use of conditionals, loops, list manipulation, and importing from other files.
- Built for command-line interaction using `input()` and simple display logic.
